/*

A Pulsar Sink is a type of connector that allows Apache Pulsar to stream data to Apache Pinot. Here is an example of a Pulsar Sink that can be used to stream data from a Pulsar topic to a Pinot table:

In this example, the MyPinotSink class extends the PinotSink class and provides implementations for the open(), write(), and close() methods. In the open() method, the Pinot client and other resources can be initialized. In the write() method, the record received from Pulsar can be written to the Pinot table. Finally, in the close() method, any resources used by the sink can be cleaned up.

Note that this is just an example and may need to be adapted to fit the specific needs of your application.
