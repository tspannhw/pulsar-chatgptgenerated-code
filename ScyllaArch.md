To build a shard-aware Pulsar connector for Scylla in Java, you will need to first familiarize yourself with the Scylla Java Driver and the Pulsar Java API. Once you have a good understanding of these two libraries, you can begin implementing the connector by following these steps:

Create a new Java project and add the Scylla Java Driver and Pulsar Java API as dependencies.

Define a ScyllaPulsarConnector class that extends the Pulsar Connector class. This class will be responsible for connecting to both Scylla and Pulsar, and for forwarding messages between the two systems.

In the ScyllaPulsarConnector class, implement a constructor that takes in the necessary connection details for both Scylla and Pulsar (e.g. hostname, port, username, password, etc.).

In the constructor, use the Scylla Java Driver to establish a connection to Scylla. You may need to create a Cluster object and a Session object to manage the connection.

Also in the constructor, use the Pulsar Java API to establish a connection to Pulsar. You will need to create a PulsarClient object to manage the connection.

Implement a method in the ScyllaPulsarConnector class that listens for messages on a specified Pulsar topic and forwards them to a specified Scylla table. This method should use the Scylla Java Driver to execute a INSERT statement on the Scylla table, using the data from the Pulsar message as the values to insert.

Test your connector by running a simple producer/consumer test that sends messages to a Pulsar topic and verifies that they are correctly inserted into the Scylla table.

Note that this is just a high-level overview of how to build a shard-aware Pulsar connector for Scylla in Java. There may be additional steps and considerations involved in implementing a production-ready connector, such as handling errors and edge cases, optimizing performance, and so on.
