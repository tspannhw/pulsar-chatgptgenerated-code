/**

To create a Pulsar connector source for Apache Pinot, you will need to use the Pulsar API to create a new connector that can subscribe to a Pulsar topic and consume the messages from that topic. The connector will then need to parse the messages and convert them into a format that can be ingested by Apache Pinot.

Here is some sample code that shows how you might create a Pulsar connector source for Apache Pinot:

This is just a simple example to show how you might go about creating a Pulsar connector source for Apache Pinot. In a real-world scenario, you would likely need to add additional logic to handle errors and failures, as well as to properly configure the connector to work with your specific Apache Pinot setup.
